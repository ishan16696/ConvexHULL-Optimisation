    "## Application of convex hull : \n",
    "1. __Collision avoidance:__ If the convex hull of a car avoids collision with obstacles then so does the car. Since the computation of paths that avoid collision is much easier with a convex car, then it is often used to plan path.<br>\n",
    "2. __Smallest box:__ The smallest area rectangle that encloses a polygon has at least one side flush with the convex hull of the polygon, and so the hull is computed at the first step of minimum rectangle algorithms. Similarly, finding the smallest three-dimensional box surrounding an object depends on the 3D-convex hull.<br>\n",
    "3. __Shape analysis:__ Shapes may be classified for the purposes of matching by their \"convex deficiency trees\", structures that depend for their computation on convex hulls.<br>\n",
    "4. Other practical applications are __pattern recognition, image processing, statistics, geographic information system, game theory, construction of phase diagrams, and static code analysis by abstract interpretation.__\n",
