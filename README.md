Convex hull and various algorithms for obtaining the 2D convex hull.
===
#### The project aims to explore different convex hull algorithms and the improvement over Standard algorithms.

**Visualization** of test cases is available in graph.ipynb

Code and test cases are available in **ishan1** Folder.

Inside folder **ishan1**
---
1. All codes and compiled version is available

2. Test cases are available in Input folder

3. ch1.txt test case is for quickhull problem 

4. Rest test cases will run for others algorithm


Running the test cases for "jarvis march" and "Improved MonoTone Chain algo " :
---
1.  copy the input for test cases file 
2.	paste it as input while runnnig executable 
3.	Result will be stored in output.csv file 
4.	Result can be visualize directly in graph.ipynb

for "graham scan" , "monotone" and "quick hull " algo : 
---
1. Result can only be checked at terminal
2. for quick hull visualization can be done by statically typing result in graph.ipynb
3. for each algo input size and time taken data is available in <algo_name>.csv file 
		this data can directly be visualize in graph.ipynb
